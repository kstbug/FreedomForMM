# FreedomForMyanmar
Collection of Tools & Services for bypassing internet censorship and protecting privacy.

Due to the current situations in Myanmar, the dictators are restricting the access to Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp & few other websites to suppress our people true voices.
Current changes in the Cyber Law also allows the dictators to intercept our people communications without any warrants and warnings.
That's totally unacceptable.

The purpose of of this repo is for our people privacy & safety on the internet without interception & restrictions.
I'm not affiliate to any of the tools & services mentioned in this list.
These are just my personal choices.

Be safe out there.
